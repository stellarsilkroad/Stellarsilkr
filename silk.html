  <h1>Silk Quilt Introduction</h1>
  <p>Over two thousand years ago, Chinese silk traveled along the Silk Road to the world, becoming a currency-like equivalent, a symbol of nobility and quality.</p>
  <p>Today, we continue this honor, using pure natural silk to create cloud-like silk quilts.</p>
  <p>The origin of silk quilts dates back five thousand years. It is not just a quilt but a gift from China to the world over millennia.</p>

  <p>From the ancient Silk Road to modern civilization, silk has always been the world's top natural textile. We insist on using 100% natural silk to make our quilts.</p>
